```sh
$ go run server/server.go
```

$ go run client/client.go
```

# Optional command line flags
The server and client both take optional command line flags.the
client and server run without TLS by default. To enable TLS:

```sh
$ go run server/server.go -tls=true
```

and

```sh
$ go run client/client.go -tls=true
```
